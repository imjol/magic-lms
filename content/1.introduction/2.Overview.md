MagicLMS is different in what ways?

For the Admins: Our powerful Admin Panel gives you full control over the platform. MagicLMS makes management easy by letting you do everything from keeping track of users to making payment plans for teachers and keeping an eye on commission-based income.

For Instructors: You can make as many video courses, text-based lessons, quizzes, and even live Zoom classes as you want with these tools. MagicLMS makes it easy to set custom course prices, share tools that can be downloaded, and keep track of each student's progress.

For Students: Courses that are made to fit your needs will open up a world of learning possibilities. You can talk to your teachers privately, join conversation forums, and keep track of your progress, among other interactive features. Finish classes and get certificates to show what you've done.
